            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Potion of Time is an abstract clock
                that was created as a final project
                for the KIPRO (Kickstart Algorithmic
                Thinking & Programming) module.
                For this module we had to try
                to develop a new graphical concept
                for the representation of time.
                The only requirement was that the
                website had to be implemented in
                the online editor provided by p5js.
                org.
                My work consists of a self-painted
                picture of a wall shelf on which various
                magical objects are placed. If
                you look at it for a while, you will
                notice that the empty potion jar
                with the skull on it is slowly filling
                up. The surroundings also change.
                Everything ages and eventually
                decays. But when a new day comes,
                everything is reset.
                I was able to improve and deepen
                my knowledge of Java Script
                through this project. I also learnt a
                few drawing tricks that I will definitely
                use in the future.
