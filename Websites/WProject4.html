            <!-- Overview -->
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Blade Runner is a website that I created in a
                group. The website runs parallel to the 1982
                film Blade Runner and provides the viewer with
                additional information about various scenes in
                the film. We used Visual studio code and Git-
                Hub as programs in this Project. The design of
                the website was created by my partner Kjartan
                Asgeirsson. I was responsible for programming
                the website and created the snap-scroll. In the
                beginning, we each worked on our own code
                and discussed the results in between so that
                we could incorporate direct suggestions for
                improvement. At first I programmed the whole
                thing with a grid. But the snap-scroll did not
                work the way we wanted. So I reprogrammed
                the whole thing with flexboxes and just used
                the grid for the content. It was also important to
                us that when scrolling down, each area started
                with the first box and not the top one. In the
                end, we only put together a few scenes from
                the film, taking into account the teachers‘
