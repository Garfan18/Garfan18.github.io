        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            „Zeitschleife“ is the product of my first attempt in my programming classes. This project introduced me to C# and the Visual Studio IDE. The first task was to create a story for the player in which they had to pick different choises at certain points. Depending on the choice they make, it was either game over or the story continued. Of course, due to my penchant for horror, I wrote a rather brutal horror story. The good thing about learning was that I could always apply what I had learned directly to the game, which made it easier for me to remember everything. In the beginning, however, I had a problem with keeping track of the code. I quickly realized that comments play a big part in this, so now I always make sure that everything in the code is well annotated and divided up. Another point of criticism which I only noticed when I let other people play my game is that I wrote the story myself, so the right answers in the decisions make sense to me, but not to other people. Everyone has a different logical way of thinking, which is why a lot of people had a game over very quickly. I will definitely keep this in mind for my future projects.
