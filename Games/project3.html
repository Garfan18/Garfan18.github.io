        <!-- Overview -->
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            The project „Universal Paradises“ was my design work for my vocational baccalaureate.
We were given the word „paradise“ as the theme for our final project and the rest
was up to us. For this project I created a PC game that allows you to enter someone
else‘s paradise. However, due to time constraints, only my paradise ended up in the
final project. I drew the paradise on an Oculus Quest 2 using Tilt Brush and imported
it into Unity. To get to my paradise, however, you first have to get through two corridors.
The first corridor was full of doors belonging to different people, and the second
corridor contained doors to different paradises belonging to the same person.
Another difficulty was that access was only granted if the correct name was entered
at the beginning. With this project I was able to repeat and consolidate some of the
game mechanics from the platform game, but also learn new things like importing
different models.
